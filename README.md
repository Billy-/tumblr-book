TumblrBook
===========

<h5>Created by Zach Saucier</h5>

<p>TumblrBook is a javascript project to make any Tumblr blog into a book, no matter what the content is. TumblrBook is currently in the not fully released, as some major functions are missing and serious styling needs to be done.</p>

<strong>Things to do:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make the output look attractive! (style it)</strong></li>
<li>Handle audio from other sources? (other than SoundCloud or user uploaded)</li>
<li>Handle user uploaded videos?</li>
<li>Paragraph indent? text-indent: .3in; BROKEN ON 2+ Ps BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT Ps</li>
<li><strong>Create a site with forms to easily customize the ouput</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add more themes</strong></li>
</ul>
